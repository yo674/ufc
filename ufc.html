            <p>Alex Pereira is a Brazilian mixed martial artist and former kickboxer: <br>
                Early life:<br>
                Pereira was born on July 7, 1987 in Favela. He dropped out of middle school to work as a bricklayer's assistant and in a tire shop. He became an alcoholic due to peer pressure. <br>
                Amateur boxing:<br>
                Pereira had a notable amateur boxing career in Brazil, with a record of 25 wins and 3 losses. His signature power, especially his left hook, was evident early in his career. <br>
                Kickboxing:<br>
                Pereira became the Glory middleweight champion in 2017 and the Glory interim light heavyweight champion in 2019. He was the only man to hold two Glory titles at the same time. <br>
                Mixed martial arts:<br>
                Pereira transitioned to mixed martial arts in 2015 at Jungle Fight 82. He made his UFC debut at UFC 268, defeating Andreas Michailidis by second round TKO. <br>
                UFC titles:<br>
                Pereira became the UFC middleweight champion after defeating Israel Adesanya at UFC 281. He lost the belt to Adesanya at UFC 287, but moved up to 205 pounds and defeated Jiří Procházka at UFC 295 to win the light heavyweight title.<br> 
                Fighting style:<br>
                Pereira's fighting style is aggressive counterpunching, built on his mastery of footwork. He uses his footwork to generate power and keep himself safe while setting up counters. </p>
